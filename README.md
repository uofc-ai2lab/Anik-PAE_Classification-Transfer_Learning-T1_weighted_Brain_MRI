## Overview* <a name="overview"></a>
Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) refers to the exposure of the developing fetus due to alcohol consumption during pregnancy, which disrupts the neurodevelopmental process and may result in long-term cognitive and behavioral abnormalities. Pediatric (2 to 8 years old) brain abnormalities associated with PAE are often subtle and differ across individuals, complicating early diagnosis. Although deep learning (DL) approaches have been promising in adult-centric brain magnetic resonance (MR) image analysis, there are challenges in pediatric-specific analysis due to limited data and a lack of explainability insights. This study incorporated deep transfer learning (TL) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to classify between unexposed controls and PAE in pediatric brain MR scans, followed by identifying brain regions (features) that were responsible for the decision-making process.
